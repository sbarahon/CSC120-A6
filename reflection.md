- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

I feel like inheritance definitely makes a lot of things easier! It would have been a lot of work to rewrite the shared methods within every class and like mentioned in class, definitely makes less room for errors. I can see why inheritance makes for efficient code and code-writing.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Something that worked was using the building class and then adding on to it, whether it be specific attributes or additional methods. I think most parts of the homeowork were straightforward! I was a tad bit confused on how some of the parameters worked for the child classes but it made sense to initialize empty types of certain objects within the constructor and then fill them in as methods are used. Advice I would give to someone taking the course in the future is asking for clarification when you need it!
